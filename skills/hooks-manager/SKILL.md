# Hooks Manager

Configure Claude Code, Codex, and Cursor hooks as event-driven commands or prompts. Use hooks for validation, logging, formatting, notifications, context injection, and bounded completion checks. Treat platform syntax and capabilities as distinct; do not copy a Claude configuration into Codex or Cursor without adapting it.

## Quick workflow

1. Identify the target platform and load `references/router.md`.
2. Load the platform reference: `claude-code.md`, `codex.md`, or `cursor.md`.
3. Identify the scope and file path for that platform.
4. Select a supported lifecycle event and adapt the shared payload/decision contract.
5. Choose a command hook for deterministic shell logic, or a prompt hook when natural-language reasoning is required and the platform supports it.
6. Validate the native config and run the platform-specific smoke check.

## Claude-shaped example

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [
          { "type": "command", "command": "./.claude/hooks/check.sh", "timeout": 30000 }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Command hooks receive JSON on stdin and may return JSON on stdout. Prompt hooks receive `#$ARGUMENTS` and should return a structured decision. Blocking hooks use `{"decision":"block","reason":"..."}`; non-blocking hooks may return a `systemMessage`.

## Safety requirements

- Check `stop_hook_active` in `Stop` and `SubagentStop` hooks to prevent recursive blocking.
- Set reasonable timeouts, especially for external commands.
- Use `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` or another trusted absolute path for scripts.
- Validate hook JSON with `jq` before relying on it.
- Keep blocking rules selective so normal work is not accidentally interrupted.
- Ensure referenced scripts are executable.

## Shared router

When the user asks for a hook that should work across agents, define one portable script with a small adapter per platform. Keep platform-specific event names, input fields, output decisions, exit codes, timeouts, and config paths in the references rather than pretending the formats are identical. Report unsupported features explicitly.
