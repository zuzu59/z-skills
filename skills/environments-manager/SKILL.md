# Environments Manager

Set up per-worktree environments so a fresh worktree is instantly ready to run: env files copied, dependencies installed, isolated database created, and common commands one click away. Supports Claude Code, Cursor, and Codex - the **shared scripts are the same on every IDE**; only the config file that points at them differs.

## Interactive Flow

This skill is interactive. Ask the user the two questions below before writing anything - the right setup depends on the project. Use whichever interactive question mechanism the host harness provides. Do not assume answers.

### Step 1: What should happen in a fresh worktree?

Ask the user what the setup script should do, as a multi-select. The first option is the default-on baseline; the rest are additive opt-ins:

| Option | What it adds to `scripts/worktree-up.sh` |
| :--- | :--- |
| Copy ignored env files from the source checkout | `cp` of `.env`, `.env.local`, `.env.development.local` (default - almost always wanted) |
| Install dependencies | `pnpm install` / `bun install` / `npm install` based on lockfile |
| Create an isolated database for this worktree | Build a unique DB name from the worktree dir, rewrite `DATABASE_URL` in `.env`, run `createdb` + import |
| Run codegen (Prisma, Drizzle, generated types) | `pnpm prisma:generate` / `bun run db:generate` / etc. |

If the user has project-specific steps (seed data, S3 sync, etc.), ask a follow-up free-form question to capture them.

### Step 2: Which IDEs should be wired up?

Ask a multi-select with options: Claude Code, Cursor, Codex. The user can pick any combination - the shared `scripts/` directory only gets generated once.

### Step 3: Apply each selected IDE

For each selected IDE, read the matching reference file and apply only its linking config. Do not duplicate the script logic - the IDE config just points at `scripts/worktree-up.sh`, `scripts/worktree-down.sh`, and `scripts/dev.sh`.

- Claude Code → load `references/claude.md`
- Cursor → load `references/cursor.md`
- Codex → load `references/codex.md`

## Shared Shape

Every project that uses this skill ends up with:

```text
scripts/
├── worktree-up.sh        # idempotent setup
├── worktree-down.sh      # cleanup before worktree teardown
├── dev.sh                # start dev server on a free port
└── (project-specific helpers, all *.sh)
```

Plus one or more IDE config files (see references). The IDE config is thin; all logic lives in `scripts/`.

**Naming convention**: every generated script MUST end in `.sh`. No bare `worktree-up`, no `dev`. IDE configs reference scripts by full filename (`scripts/worktree-up.sh`, not `scripts/worktree-up`). This is enforced in every reference file and example.

## Environment Variable Cascade

Each IDE exposes different variables. The shared scripts accept all of them, in this priority:

```bash
WORKTREE_PATH="${CODEX_WORKTREE_PATH:-${CURSOR_WORKTREE_PATH:-$(pwd)}}"
SOURCE_PATH="${CODEX_SOURCE_TREE_PATH:-${ROOT_WORKTREE_PATH:-}}"
```

| Platform | Worktree path | Source checkout path | Setup trigger |
| :------- | :----------------------- | :------------------------ | :--- |
| Codex    | `$CODEX_WORKTREE_PATH`   | `$CODEX_SOURCE_TREE_PATH` | `[setup] script` in TOML, runs once per worktree |
| Cursor   | `pwd` inside worktree    | `$ROOT_WORKTREE_PATH`     | `setup-worktree-unix` in JSON, runs once per worktree |
| Claude   | `pwd` inside worktree (the hook wrapper cd's in) | `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` (source repo, exposed inside the hook); the wrapper re-exports it as `ROOT_WORKTREE_PATH` | `WorktreeCreate` hook, runs once per worktree |

**Important about Claude Code**: do NOT use `SessionStart` for setup - it fires every session. Use the `WorktreeCreate` hook, which fires once when `claude --worktree` creates the worktree. The Claude wrapper script (`scripts/claude-worktree-create.sh`) is responsible for calling `git worktree add` itself, then handing off to `scripts/worktree-up.sh` inside the new worktree with `ROOT_WORKTREE_PATH` set. See [references/claude.md](references/claude.md).

If no env var yields a source checkout, fall back to a project-specific absolute path (e.g. `$HOME/Developer/saas/<repo>`). Ask the user during Step 1 if you cannot infer it.

## `scripts/worktree-up.sh`

Setup must be **idempotent** - reruns are safe. Built from the user's Step 1 selections. Required behavior in order:

1. `set -euo pipefail`.
2. Resolve `WORKTREE_PATH` and `SOURCE_PATH`.
3. `cd "$WORKTREE_PATH"`.
4. If "Copy env files" selected: copy `.env`, `.env.local`, `.env.development.local` only when the source has them and the worktree does not.
5. If "Install dependencies" selected: detect from lockfile and run the matching install.
6. If "Isolated database" selected: build a DB name from `basename "$WORKTREE_PATH" | tr '/' '-'`, rewrite only `DATABASE_URL` (and any related vars) in the copied `.env`, create the DB if missing. Provide a reset escape hatch: `<PROJECT>_RESET_DB=1` drops and recreates.
7. If "Codegen" selected: run the project's codegen command.
8. Append any free-form project-specific steps from Step 1.

Reference template (adjust based on selections):

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

WORKTREE_PATH="${CODEX_WORKTREE_PATH:-${CURSOR_WORKTREE_PATH:-$(pwd)}}"
SOURCE_PATH="${CODEX_SOURCE_TREE_PATH:-${ROOT_WORKTREE_PATH:-$HOME/Developer/saas/<repo>}}"

cd "$WORKTREE_PATH"

# Copy ignored env files.
# NOTE for Claude Code users: .worktreeinclude handles this natively. Prefer it
# over the cp loop when the project uses Claude's --worktree.
for f in .env .env.local .env.development.local; do
  if [[ -f "$SOURCE_PATH/$f" && ! -f "$WORKTREE_PATH/$f" ]]; then
    cp "$SOURCE_PATH/$f" "$WORKTREE_PATH/$f"
    echo "copied $f"
  fi
done

# Install deps
if   [[ -f pnpm-lock.yaml ]]; then pnpm install
elif [[ -f bun.lock || -f bun.lockb ]]; then bun install
elif [[ -f yarn.lock ]]; then yarn install
elif [[ -f package-lock.json ]]; then npm install
fi

# Project-specific DB isolation and codegen go here.
```

## `scripts/worktree-down.sh`

Cleanup runs before the IDE destroys the worktree.

1. `set -euo pipefail`.
2. `cd "$WORKTREE_PATH"`.
3. Read DB names from the worktree `.env`. **Never guess from branch names.**
4. `dropdb --if-exists` per DB found, against a maintenance database.
5. Remove copied env files.
6. If env files or PostgreSQL tools are missing, print one short message and exit 0.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

WORKTREE_PATH="${CODEX_WORKTREE_PATH:-${CURSOR_WORKTREE_PATH:-$(pwd)}}"
cd "$WORKTREE_PATH"

if [[ ! -f .env ]]; then
  echo "no .env in worktree, nothing to clean"
  exit 0
fi

db_name=$(grep -E '^DATABASE_URL=' .env | sed -E 's|.*/([^/?]+).*|\1|' | head -n1 || true)
if [[ -n "${db_name:-}" ]] && command -v dropdb >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  dropdb --if-exists -d postgres "$db_name" || true
fi

rm -f .env .env.local .env.development.local
```

## `scripts/dev.sh`

Pick a free port so multiple worktrees can run in parallel.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

WORKTREE_PATH="${CODEX_WORKTREE_PATH:-${CURSOR_WORKTREE_PATH:-$(pwd)}}"
cd "$WORKTREE_PATH"

port="${DEV_PORT_START:-3910}"
while lsof -nP -iTCP:"$port" -sTCP:LISTEN >/dev/null 2>&1; do
  port=$((port + 1))
done

echo "Starting app on http://localhost:$port"
exec pnpm dev -p "$port"  # adjust for the project package manager
```

## Standard Actions

Every project should expose these four actions through the IDE's own mechanism (see references). Wire them per IDE.

| Action     | Command (typical)                |
| :--------- | :------------------------------- |
| Dev        | `scripts/dev.sh`                    |
| Typecheck  | `pnpm ts` / `bun run typecheck`  |
| Unit tests | `pnpm test:ci` / `bun test`      |
| Lint       | `pnpm lint:ci` / `bun run lint`  |

Add `E2E` as an action only if the suite is cheap enough to run interactively.

## Universal Guardrails

- Never commit secrets. Copying ignored env files into a local worktree is fine; logging them is not.
- Never drop a database whose name was guessed from a branch. Read it from the worktree `.env`.
- Never put fragile multi-line shell programs inside an IDE config file. Keep all logic in `scripts/`; the IDE config just calls those scripts.
- Never hardcode a dev port. Pick a free one starting from `${DEV_PORT_START:-3910}`.
- Setup must be idempotent. Provide a reset escape hatch via env var (`<PROJECT>_RESET_DB=1`).
- Print DB names and redacted hosts only.
- The scripts and IDE config must live on the source checkout / main branch, not only the current worktree, or future worktrees will have nothing to copy.
- **Never import data from a production source.** Any setup step that exports a database/deployment and replays it into the new worktree MUST reject any source ref containing `prod`/`production` and require an explicit override env var (`<PROJECT>_ALLOW_PROD_SOURCE=1`). Even a single mistaken `--replace-all` against the wrong source can nuke a teammate's dev environment or, worse, leak prod data into a feature branch. Default the source to `dev` and validate before each export.

```bash
assert_dev_source() {
  case "$1" in
    prod|prod:*|prod/*|production|production:*|production/*)
      echo "refusing prod source: $1" >&2; exit 1 ;;
    *prod*|*production*)
      [ "${ALLOW_PROD_SOURCE:-0}" = "1" ] || { echo "looks like prod: $1" >&2; exit 1; } ;;
  esac
}
```

- **Hook wrappers must survive a missing `/dev/tty`, a wrong default Node version, and CLI prompts.** See `references/claude.md` → "Hook Robustness" for the five concrete fixes.

## Verification

After generating files:

```bash
bash -n scripts/worktree-up.sh scripts/worktree-down.sh scripts/dev.sh
git status --short
```

If Python 3.11+ is available, validate any generated TOML:

```bash
python3 - <<'PY'
import tomllib
with open(".codex/environments/environment.toml", "rb") as f:
    tomllib.load(f)
PY
```

For JSON configs:

```bash
python3 -c "import json; json.load(open('.cursor/worktrees.json'))"
python3 -c "import json; json.load(open('.claude/settings.json'))"
```

## IDE-Specific Linking

After the shared scripts are written, for each IDE selected in Step 2, load the matching reference file and apply only its linking config:

- **Claude Code** → [references/claude.md](references/claude.md) - `.claude/settings.json` worktree hooks + optional project action skills.
- **Cursor** → [references/cursor.md](references/cursor.md) - `.cursor/worktrees.json` setup keys.
- **Codex** → [references/codex.md](references/codex.md) - `.codex/environments/environment.toml` setup, cleanup, and actions.

If multiple IDEs were selected, generate `scripts/` once and then apply each reference in turn.

## Examples

Working copies of every file this skill generates live under [examples/](examples/). Use them as the source-of-truth shape when writing into a real project. Adapt the project section (package manager, DB name prefix, codegen step) for the target repo.

```text
examples/
├── scripts/
│   ├── worktree-up.sh             # pnpm + Postgres + Prisma reference
│   ├── worktree-down.sh           # pnpm + Postgres reference
│   ├── dev.sh                     # free-port dev server reference
│   ├── claude-worktree-create.sh  # Claude WorktreeCreate hook wrapper
│   └── claude-worktree-remove.sh  # Claude WorktreeRemove hook wrapper
├── claude/
│   ├── .worktreeinclude           # native env-file copy list
│   ├── settings.json              # WorktreeCreate + WorktreeRemove hooks
├── skills/                        # optional project action skills
│   ├── dev/SKILL.md
│   ├── typecheck/SKILL.md
│   ├── test/SKILL.md
│   └── lint/SKILL.md
├── cursor/
│   └── worktrees.json             # setup-worktree-unix -> scripts/worktree-up.sh
└── codex/
    └── environments/
        └── environment.toml       # setup, cleanup, four actions
```

Read the relevant example before writing the file into the target project. Do not copy verbatim - the user's Step 1 selections determine which sections of `worktree-up.sh` survive.
