description: Setup the Ralph autonomous AI coding loop - ships features while you sleep
argument-hint: "<project-path> [-i/--interactive] [-f/--feature <name>]"
---

<objective>
Set up the Ralph autonomous coding loop in any project. Ralph runs AI agents in a loop, picking tasks from a PRD, implementing one at a time, committing after each, and accumulating learnings until all tasks are complete.

**This skill ONLY sets up Ralph - you run the commands yourself.**
</objective>

<quick_start>
**Setup Ralph interactively (recommended):**
```bash
/setup-ralph -i
```

**Setup for specific feature:**
```bash
/setup-ralph -f 01-add-authentication
```

**What this does:**
1. Creates `.claude/ralph/` structure in your project
2. Runs setup script to create all Ralph files
3. (If -i): Brainstorms PRD with you interactively
4. Transforms PRD into user stories (prd.json)
5. Shows you the command to run Ralph (you run it yourself)

**After setup, you run:**
```bash
bun run .claude/ralph/ralph.sh -f <feature-name>
```
</quick_start>

<critical_rule>
🛑 NEVER run ralph.sh or any execution commands automatically
🛑 NEVER execute the loop - only set up files and show instructions
✅ ALWAYS let the user copy and run commands themselves
✅ ALWAYS end by showing the exact command to run
</critical_rule>

<when_to_use>
**Use this skill when:**
- Starting a new feature that can be broken into small stories
- Setting up Ralph in a new project
- Creating a new feature PRD interactively

**Don't use for:**
- Simple single-file changes
- Exploratory work without clear requirements
- Major refactors without acceptance criteria
</when_to_use>

<parameters>
| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `<project-path>` | Path to the project (defaults to current directory) |
| `-i, --interactive` | Interactive mode: brainstorm PRD with AI assistance |
| `-f, --feature <name>` | Feature folder name (e.g., `01-add-auth`) |

**Examples:**
```bash
/setup-ralph /path/to/project -i              # Interactive PRD creation
/setup-ralph . -f 01-add-auth                 # Setup for specific feature
/setup-ralph -i -f 02-user-dashboard          # Interactive with specific name
```
</parameters>

<state_variables>
| Variable | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `{project_path}` | string | Absolute path to target project |
| `{ralph_dir}` | string | Path to .claude/ralph in project |
| `{feature_name}` | string | Feature folder name (e.g., `01-add-auth`) |
| `{feature_dir}` | string | Path to task folder |
| `{interactive_mode}` | boolean | Whether to brainstorm PRD interactively |
| `{prd_content}` | string | PRD markdown content |
| `{user_stories}` | array | User stories extracted from PRD |
| `{branch_name}` | string | Git branch for the feature |
</state_variables>

<entry_point>
Load `steps/step-00-init.md`
</entry_point>

<step_files>
| Step | File | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| 00 | `step-00-init.md` | Parse flags, run setup script, create structure |
| 01 | `step-01-interactive-prd.md` | Interactive PRD brainstorming and creation |
| 02 | `step-02-create-stories.md` | Transform PRD into user stories (prd.json) |
| 03 | `step-03-finish.md` | Show run command (user runs it themselves) |
</step_files>

<scripts>
| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `scripts/setup.sh` | Creates all Ralph files in the project |
</scripts>

<execution_rules>
1. **Progressive Loading**: Load one step at a time
2. **Script Execution**: Use scripts/setup.sh to create files atomically
3. **Interactive Mode**: If -i flag, run brainstorming conversation
4. **State Persistence**: Track progress in feature_dir/progress.txt
5. **Resume Support**: Detect existing PRD.md and resume from there
6. **NEVER RUN RALPH**: Only setup and show commands - user runs them
</execution_rules>

<success_criteria>
✅ Ralph structure created at {project_path}/.claude/ralph
✅ Feature folder created with PRD.md, prd.json, progress.txt
✅ User stories properly formatted in prd.json
✅ Clear run command provided to user (they run it themselves)
</success_criteria>
