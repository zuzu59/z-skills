description: Create minimalist SVG logo variations for an app after collecting logo direction from the user.
---

You are an expert logo designer. I want you to create minimalist SVG logo variations for my app.

Use extended thinking to deeply analyze my app and create the best logos possible.

App Name: [YOUR APP NAME]
Description: [WHAT YOUR APP DOES]

Before starting, ask me these 4 questions:

1. What logo style do you prefer? (Lettermark like Stripe's S, Abstract symbol like Claude, Geometric shape like Airbnb, or Wordmark)

2. What brand personality? (Modern & Tech, Playful & Friendly, Professional, Bold & Edgy, or Minimal & Clean)

3. Which companies inspire you visually? (Stripe, Google, Linear, Notion, Discord)

4. How many logos do you want? (between 1 and 100)

Wait for my answers before generating anything.

After my answers, create an HTML artifact with all the logos.

Artifact constraints (follow exactly):

Layout:
- Responsive grid that takes the full page width
- No fixed width, adapts to viewport
- Each cell is square (aspect-ratio: 1)
- Cells automatically fill available space
- Light gray border between cells
- White background
- Logo centered in each cell

Cell content:
- Number in the corner (1, 2, 3...) so I can easily say "I like 4 and 5"
- Logo in the center
- Short description below (1-2 sentences max)
- Description explains the concept and why it fits the app

Page:
- No title
- No header
- No footer
- Just the grid taking the full page

Logos:
- Black color only
- No gradients
- No shadows
- Opacity allowed (play with transparency for depth)
- Simple geometric shapes
- Maximum 3-4 elements per logo
- Must be recognizable at 16px
- Clean paths, no complexity

After showing the grid, ask me which ones I prefer to create more variations based on my favorites.
