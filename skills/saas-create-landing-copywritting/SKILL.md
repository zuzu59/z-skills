description: Generate conversion-focused landing page copywriting based on PRD and marketing context
---

<objective>
Generate a complete, ready-to-use landing page copywriting document that converts visitors into customers.

Focus on benefits over features, emotional resonance, and proven conversion frameworks. This comes AFTER the PRD and ARCHI - the PRD defines WHAT to build, ARCHI defines HOW, this creates the COPY that sells.
</objective>

<process>
## Phase 1: Locate Project Files

1. **Ask for project location**:
   > "Where is your project located?"

2. **Find and read all files** (use Glob):
   - `**/PRD.md` or `**/*prd*.md`
   - `**/ARCHI.md` or `**/*archi*.md`
   - `**/*marketing*/**/*.md`
   - `**/*objection*.md`
   - `**/*competitive*.md`

3. **Save PRD directory path** - Create LANDING_PAGE.md in SAME directory as PRD

## Phase 2: Extract Context

4. **From PRD extract**:
   - Target users and personas
   - Pain points and problems
   - Features and solutions
   - Success metrics

5. **From ARCHI extract**:
   - Technical advantages to translate into benefits
   - Unique capabilities

6. **From marketing files extract**:
   - Existing headlines and value props
   - Objections that need handling
   - Competitive positioning angles

## Phase 3: Research Best Practices

7. **Web search for**:
   - "SaaS landing page copywriting 2025 best practices"
   - "conversion copywriting frameworks AIDA PAS PRESTO"
   - "high converting landing page examples [industry]"

8. **Analyze 3-5 top landing pages** in same category using WebFetch

## Phase 4: Choose Framework

9. **Select copywriting framework**:

**AIDA** (Attention, Interest, Desire, Action):
- Use for: Broad audiences, new categories, educational sells
- Best when: Need to build interest gradually

**PAS** (Problem, Agitate, Solution):
- Use for: Strong pain points, clear problems, urgent needs
- Best when: Users actively seeking solutions

**PRESTO** (Promise, Repeat, Evidence, Stakes, Transition, Offer):
- Use for: Complex products, B2B, service-heavy SaaS
- Best when: Longer sales cycles, need credibility building

**Hybrid**: Combine frameworks for different sections

## Phase 5: Generate Copy

10. **Create LANDING_PAGE.md** with ALL sections:

```markdown
